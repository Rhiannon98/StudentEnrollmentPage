## Student Enrollment
  A project to practice building a full CRUD MVC as well as practice in app deployment through Azure.

  Someone can go onto the site to enroll a student, delete a student, create a course, and delete a course as long as it has no students within.

  Editing student information and course information is also a feature. 

### Getting Started:
[Here]() is the link to the website to visit

In order to interact with the website should it be down, follow
the protocol below:
- Download the most recent [.NET SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/all)
- Navigate and download the project files
- Once open, make sure to creat a local database for the CRUD operations to work properly.
- In the PM console, use Update-Database as it will take the existing migrations with the project and create a new setup for you
	- (note: sometimes it will say install EF core and sometimes it does it for you)
- After completed with the above, you should be seeing a site either the same as the one in the visuals below, or one even better! (hopefully)

Have fun running the application, explore the Students and Courses tabs for the afformentioned functionality.
